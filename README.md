and CDN URL to display a PDF.

## Live Example

## Running Locally

Clone this repo and `cd` into the directory:

    git clone git@github.com:Accusoft/hello-accusoft-pdf-viewer-via-cdn.git
    cd hello-accusoft-pdf-viewer-via-cdn

Launch a local web server for the directory and open a browser to view the
sample. For example, if you have npm installed, you can run:

    npx serve

This will start a local web server running at (typically)
`http://localhost:5000`. Open this URL in your browser to view the sample.
